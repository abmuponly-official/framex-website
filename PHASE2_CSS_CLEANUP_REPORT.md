- Redundant footer CSS

### After Phase 2  
- **CSS files:** 22 files ✅ (reduced by 21%)
- Clean, organized structure

## 📝 What Was Done

### 1. Removed Unused Comparison Table CSS (4 files)
**Removed:**
- `comparison-table-clean.css` ❌
- `comparison-table-i18n.css` ❌
- `comparison-table-light-theme.css` ❌
- `comparison-table-white-bg.css` ❌

**Kept:**

**Why safe:** Only one was referenced in HTML files. Others were test versions.

### 2. Consolidated Footer CSS (3→1 file)
**Before:** 3 separate files
- `footer-v2.css` (460 lines)
- `footer-fixes.css` (239 lines)
- `footer-white-override.css` (158 lines)

**After:** 1 unified file

- Fewer HTTP requests
- Easier maintenance
- All footer styles in one place

## 🎓 Learning Points

### CSS Management Best Practices

1. **Don't Keep Test Versions**
   - We had 5 comparison-table CSS files!
   - Only 1 was actually used
   - Delete experiments after choosing final

2. **Consolidate Related Styles**
   - 3 footer CSS → 1 unified file
   - Reduces complexity
   - Faster page load

3. **Clear Naming Convention**
   ```
   ❌ BAD:  component-clean.css, component-light.css, component-redesign.css
   ✅ GOOD: component.css (one final version)
   ```

4. **Use Git for History**
   - No need to keep old versions as separate files
   - Git tracks all changes
