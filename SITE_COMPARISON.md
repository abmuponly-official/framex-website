# Site Comparison Report

## Current Status

- **Products** (products.html) - Display correctly  

### ❌ Pages Need Fix (Not matching framex.vn)
1. **About** (about.html)
2. **Projects** (projects.html)
3. **Blog** (blog.html)
4. **Contact** (contact.html)
5. **Investor Relations** (investor-relations.html)

## Problem Analysis

The local site (port 8000) is using a new design system with:
- css/design-system.css
- css/components.css
- css/responsive-grid.css

While framex.vn appears to use a different/older design.

## Solution Approach

Since user wants to "giữ nguyên giao diện so với website gốc" (keep the same interface as the original website), I need to:

1. Check what CSS/structure framex.vn is actually using
2. Update local pages to match exactly
3. May need to revert to older HTML/CSS structure
4. Ensure Vietnamese content displays correctly

## Next Steps

1. Analyze framex.vn page structure more carefully
2. Potentially revert pages to match original design
3. Fix content and encoding issues
4. Test thoroughly
